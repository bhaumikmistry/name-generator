a light weight c++ library to generate names on the for repetative and different task.

for instance 
```
char bufer[201];
sprintf(outname,"%s_%s_%s.txt",country,city,time);
sprintf(outname,"%s_%s_%s.txt",longitude,latitude,time);
```
This task can be simplified and generated by treating each sub string as one of the `Sub` to the full name by creating an `object` of each file name localy or resuing the object as per the design.
